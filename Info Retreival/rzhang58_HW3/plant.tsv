107	2	<S> But the union has taken the position that the 1985 agreement calls for concessions only in exchange for building a totally new product ; the union doesn't consider the Omni and Horizon models " new " since they are currently built at Chrysler 's Belvidere , Ill , .X-PLANT </S>
108	2	<S> " Given an average of 4,000 employees per .X-PLANT , " Mr Jacobson says , " we estimate that a typical integrated-plant closure today would cost over $300 million " </S>

122	1	<S> Irish moss , Chondrus crispus , is a purplish to pink red .X-PLANT in the red ALGAE division , Rhodophycophyta </S>
123	1	<S> It is further classified according to grade , or purity , defined as the percentage of carbon content ; according to type , depending on variations in the original .X-PLANT composition ; and according to rank , depending on the degree of metamorphism </S>
124	1	<S> It is suggested that the differences in the photosynthetic performance of the three .X-PLANT groups studied are due , in part , to differences in the mechanisms by which these organisms acquire inorganic carbon from their environment and to the presence or absence of a mechanism for concentrating inorganic carbon within the cells </S>
125	1	<S> It seems inconsistent to place one in the .X-PLANT kingdom and the other in the animal kingdom ; thus some zoologists claim all such pairs of species as Protozoa , whereas botanists claim them as Algae </S>
126	1	<S> More conidia were present in the early morning and within the .X-PLANT canopy than in the late afternoon or on lesions directly exposed to the sun </S>

133	2	<S> The derived demand equations contain only input prices and .X-PLANT output as exogenous variables </S>
134	1	<S> The horticultural development of particular varieties ( cultivars ) of a .X-PLANT species to satisfy commercial requirements , such as high yield , has led to the appearance of different races of a single pathogen , which are specialized in their ability to attack the different cultivars </S>
135	1	<S> The important feature of these fuels is that they are renewable , because the .X-PLANT life will generate a new crop after some determinable period of time Fuel derived from photosynthesis is also produced through the accumulation of decaying animal and vegetable matter over long periods of time </S>
136	1	<S> The parental strain K60 is virulent , attaches poorly to .X-PLANT cells and is almost devoid of fimbriae </S>

154	2	<S> The Shoreham plant was completed months ago but still hasn't been federally licensed because of state and local opposition over the adequacy of Lilco 's emergency evacuation plan for the area surrounding the .X-PLANT </S>
