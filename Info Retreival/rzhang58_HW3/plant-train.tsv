107	2	<S> But the union has taken the position that the 1985 agreement calls for concessions only in exchange for building a totally new product ; the union doesn't consider the Omni and Horizon models " new " since they are currently built at Chrysler 's Belvidere , Ill , .X-PLANT </S>
108	2	<S> " Given an average of 4,000 employees per .X-PLANT , " Mr Jacobson says , " we estimate that a typical integrated-plant closure today would cost over $300 million " </S>

122	1	<S> Irish moss , Chondrus crispus , is a purplish to pink red .X-PLANT in the red ALGAE division , Rhodophycophyta </S>
123	1	<S> It is further classified according to grade , or purity , defined as the percentage of carbon content ; according to type , depending on variations in the original .X-PLANT composition ; and according to rank , depending on the degree of metamorphism </S>
124	1	<S> It is suggested that the differences in the photosynthetic performance of the three .X-PLANT groups studied are due , in part , to differences in the mechanisms by which these organisms acquire inorganic carbon from their environment and to the presence or absence of a mechanism for concentrating inorganic carbon within the cells </S>
125	1	<S> It seems inconsistent to place one in the .X-PLANT kingdom and the other in the animal kingdom ; thus some zoologists claim all such pairs of species as Protozoa , whereas botanists claim them as Algae </S>

133	2	<S> The derived demand equations contain only input prices and .X-PLANT output as exogenous variables </S>
134	1	<S> The horticultural development of particular varieties ( cultivars ) of a .X-PLANT species to satisfy commercial requirements , such as high yield , has led to the appearance of different races of a single pathogen , which are specialized in their ability to attack the different cultivars </S>
135	1	<S> The important feature of these fuels is that they are renewable , because the .X-PLANT life will generate a new crop after some determinable period of time Fuel derived from photosynthesis is also produced through the accumulation of decaying animal and vegetable matter over long periods of time </S>
136	1	<S> The parental strain K60 is virulent , attaches poorly to .X-PLANT cells and is almost devoid of fimbriae </S>
