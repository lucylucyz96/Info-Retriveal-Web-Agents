#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Well, I have to argue with you on this one.  Cathay has been very conscious
PTEXT	about its cost.  It has moved some of its operations from Hong Kong to
PTEXT	reduce costs.  The management was very aggressive in making the cockpit
PTEXT	and cabin crews to accept longer working hours and reduced benefits.  The
PTEXT	aggressiveness resulted in a walkout by the cabin crew during Chinese New
PTEXT	Year of 1993.  However, the management was firm with its position and the
PTEXT	cabin crew gave in.  CX is one the lowest cost operators among major East
PTEXT	Asian airlines even though doing business in Hong Kong is very expensive.

QUOTED	> (and before people argue with that one look at the pitiful utilisation

QUOTED	>  same way).
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Well, the L1011 utilization is not a very good example for at least two
PTEXT	reasons:
#BLANK#	
ITEM	1. CX's L1011s are used just like the B737/MD80 are used by US carriers.
ITEM	   Most of the sectors served by CX's L1011s are between 1.5 hours to 3.5
ITEM	   hours.  Furthermore, many East Asian airports have night curfews.
ITEM	   Therefore, 6-9 hours of utilization are not unreasonable.  CX is
ITEM	   definitely not alone in this category.  If you check out TG's, MH's,
ITEM	   CI's A300 and SQ's A310 utilizations, you'll find CX's L1011 number is
ITEM	   not low.  Actually, CX has been very good in keeping high utilization
ITEM	   of its long-haul aircraft.  When CX got its first few B747s in 1979/80,
ITEM	   I was shocked that the average B747 utilization for CX was around 16
ITEM	   hours a day!
#BLANK#	
ITEM	2. CX's L1011s are fully depreciated, thus, they can afford to collect
ITEM	   some dust (remember there are many more L1011s in the deserts that are
ITEM	   not generating a single cent of revenue).  I believe CX also operate a
ITEM	   lot of extra and "chartered" flights.  For example, supplement flights
ITEM	   are quite common on the HKG-TPE run.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I think you're a little bit harsh on HK.  HK has one of the freest markets
PTEXT	in the world.  Do not extrapolate HK's conservative aviation policies to
PTEXT	general trading policies.  The Hong Kong Aviation Authority may be
PTEXT	anti-competition, but the Australian government has been practicing
PTEXT	protectionism for a long long time.  To cite a few Australian
PTEXT	anti-competition aviation policies that I can remember:
#BLANK#	
ITEM	1. In early 80s, it tried to limit Southeast Asian carriers' six-freedom
ITEM	   rights from Australia to Europe (Kangaroo route).  (This is the only
ITEM	   incidence that I can remember a government made a _major_ effort to
ITEM	   impose limit on six-freedom rights.)
ITEM	2. in 1993, NW's OSA-SYD fiasco,
ITEM	3. and the recent unilateral suspension of a free market agreement
ITEM	   with New Zealand.

QUOTED	RNA>What about these?
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I addressed this in my original post, but let me summarize here.  I
PTEXT	agree that new aircraft have greater fuel efficiency and reduced
PTEXT	reliability/ maintenance costs.  At the same time, a new 100-120 seat
PTEXT	airplane (read: 737, MD-80, or 320 series) costed around $30,000,000
PTEXT	(last time I checked - around 1991) and the cost of hush-kitting an
PTEXT	older airplane like a 727 or DC-9 costs around $3,000,000 (again,
PTEXT	these figures were approximate in 1991).  Thus, the increased fuel
PTEXT	efficiency and reduced reliability/maintenance costs are *dwarfed* by
PTEXT	the ~$25,000,000 savings of using hush kits over new aircraft.  When I
PTEXT	worked at Northwest, there was a study floating around that made the
PTEXT	calculations and showed the savings to keep the old aircraft flying.
PTEXT	I wish I had a copy of this.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	As the original poster noted, this savings is especially true for the
PTEXT	DC-9s which tend to age better than the B-727 or B-737.  This explains
PTEXT	why Northwest and Valujet are holding onto a fleet of old DC-9s.  (As
PTEXT	someone noted to me in a private email, Valujet's fleet is
PTEXT	*exclusively* a DC-9 fleet).

PTEXT	wrangling and shuffling, Haw'n built its own one-story terminal near
PTEXT	Nimitz Highway. Aloha didn't like that--so they prompted an entire
PTEXT	renovation of its old terminal. Now, we have a huge, ugly parking

PTEXT	a B767 engine:
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	ATC lost radio contact with a UA jetliner over the North Altlantic as
PTEXT	the Boeing 767, having lost one of its two engines, headed on an
PTEXT	emergency course for Bermuda and flew too low to communicate with the
PTEXT	controller's antiquated radios. Contact with the airliner was lost for
PTEXT	stretches of 8-10 minutes or longer. Controllers say that if the plane
PTEXT	had been forced to ditch in the water, they would not have had a precise
PTEXT	location to send rescuers.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	A private subcontractor, Aeronautical Radio Inc., was used to relay radio
PTEXT	messages between the airliner and the ATC. The company transcribes
PTEXT	reports and then transmits them by teletype to the Controllers at he
PTEXT	FAA's New York Center. The controllers keep track of locations in their
PTEXT	heads, or use grease pencils on Plexiglas!!!!
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The incident itself was as follows: the pilot was flying at 33000 ft
PTEXT	about 330 miles south of Bermuda when he radioed that he had a possible
PTEXT	oil filter blockage in one engine and asked for permission to descend to
PTEXT	25000 ft. The controller on duty received the information on teletype,
PTEXT	telephoned Aeronautical Radio, and asked to be patched through to the
PTEXT	plane. -- that took 5 minutes and was considered to be pretty quick!
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The pilot later reported that the engine had shut down. The pilot had to
PTEXT	descend to unusually low altitudes because of a loss in cabin pressure.
PTEXT	The shut-down of one engine meant the loss of an air conditioning unit,
PTEXT	and the remaining unit overheated.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Newsweek had an article just last week on the antiquated ATC equipment!
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Fortunately, the plane was in constant contact with United's own
PTEXT	dispatchers in Chicago, via satellite link.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I'm not too fond of Cathay's management nor the British colonial

PTEXT	in where 98% of the population are Chinese.  (They didn't even put their

PTEXT	I try to avoid flying CX as much as possible.  Nevertheless, both the HK
PTEXT	Colonial Government and Cathay have made significant contributions to the
PTEXT	prosperity of HK (and made of a lot money for themselves, too).
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	BTW, the Chinese name of Cathay is literally translated as "a prosperous
PTEXT	and peaceful nation."  Let's hope the prosperity will last even after
PTEXT	1997.

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	IMHO, the future of the A340 is better than the A330.  There will

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	Interestingly that you brought up the subject.  I've previously discussed
PTEXT	this subject with Mr. Jennings through e-mail, too.  A few days ago, I
PTEXT	posted an "analysis" of the A330 program to sci.aeronautics.airliners

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	SIA is looking for a regional jet, hence, the MD-11 is definitely out of
PTEXT	the question.  Furthermore, SIA does not have a good track record with MD,
PTEXT	or, perhaps I should say MD does not have a good track record with SIA.
PTEXT	SIA dumped the DC-10 after ~ 5 years of operation.  SIA did not even take
PTEXT	the delivery of the last two (of seven) aircraft and sold them directly to
PTEXT	Varig.  Around 1990, SIA signed an MOU with MD to order up to 20 MD-11s.
PTEXT	At the time, one of the major reasons for the order was because both Delta
PTEXT	and Swissair (SIA's cross-equity partners) had ordered the MD-11s.  Later,
PTEXT	MD and P&W failed to guarantee certain performance, and SIA switched to
PTEXT	the A340.  Currently, SIA has 17 A340s on order (plus 20 options) for
PTEXT	long-haul services.  Thus, on paper, the A330 is the more likely
PTEXT	candidate, and Airbus made a news release a few weeks ago claiming that
PTEXT	they were ahead of Boeing in the SIA competition.  Last year, Boeing was
PTEXT	ready to lease eight B777s to SIA, and SIA's chairman was reported to say
PTEXT	that the deal was too sweet to refuse.  I believe the lease offer is still
PTEXT	on.

PTEXT	As I said it before, the edge apparently goes to Airbus, but I believe
PTEXT	Boeing has a good chance.
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	I don't know whether the Japanese contents in the B777 will affect SIA's
PTEXT	decision, but I believe Singapore Aerospace is a subcontractor of the B777
PTEXT	program, too.  IMHO, the B777 is better sized for the Asian market.  If I
PTEXT	were an SIA executive, I would have picked the B777.  The B777-200 may be
PTEXT	a little too big to replace some of SIA's A310s (so is the A330, and SIA
PTEXT	is reported to be looking for a smaller aircraft later on).  However, the
PTEXT	B777-300 is the most ideal aircraft to replace the B747s used for regional
PTEXT	services.  SIA's order is important to the A330 program, but I would not
PTEXT	go so far to say it's a make-or-break order for the A330.  The A330
PTEXT	program still has some other potential customers.  (See my up-coming
PTEXT	"analysis", if you are interested.)

#BLANK#	
PTEXT	747s are not good choices for short/mid-length domestic flights and are
PTEXT	essentially unused for such in the U.S.  In fact, most of the city pairs
PTEXT	you'e named above are dominated by flights on 757s, 737s, 767s, and
PTEXT	DC10s.  SFO-ORD and SFO-JFK have only a few flights on 747s, and these
PTEXT	are positioning flights for continuing international flights.  
#BLANK#	
PTEXT	The 747 is a horrible choice for the intra-Japan flights, and the only
PTEXT	reason they use them there is because Narita cannot be expanded to
PTEXT	accomodate the number of flights that would be needed to properly handle
PTEXT	these flights with 737s or similar aircraft.
